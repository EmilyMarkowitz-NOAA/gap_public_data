## Data Description

The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE)
Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) of the Alaska Fisheries Science
Center (AFSC) conducts fisheries-independent bottom trawl surveys to
monitor the condition of the demersal fish and crab stocks of Alaska.
These data are developed to describe the temporal distribution and
abundance of commercially and ecologically important groundfish species,
examine the changes in the species composition of the fauna over time
and space, and describe the physical environment of the groundfish
habitat.

There are no legal restrictions on access to the data. They reside in
the public domain and can be freely distributed. Users must read and
fully comprehend the metadata prior to use. Data should not be used
beyond the limits of the source scale. Acknowledgement of NOAA, as the
source from which these data were obtained, in any publications and/or
other representations of these data, is suggested. These data are
compiled and approved annually after each summer survey season. The data
from previous years are unlikely to change substantially once published.

These data are non-zero (presence) observations from surveys conducted
on fishing vessels. These surveys monitor trends in distribution and
abundance of groundfish, crab, and bottom-dwelling species in Alaska’s
marine ecosystems. These data include estimates of catch-per-unit-effort
(CPUE) for most identified species at a standard set of stations. Some
survey data are excluded, such as non-standard stations, surveys
completed in earlier years using different/non-standard gear, and
special tows and non-standard data collections.

Though not included in the public data, these surveys also collect
oceanographic and environmental data, and biological data such as
length, weight, stomach contents (to learn more about diet), otoliths
(fish ear bones to learn about age), and tissue samples for genetic
analysis, all of which can be shared upon special request. Also not
included in the public data are estimated biomass (average total weight
of all fish and crabs sampled) of crabs and groundfish that support the
creation of annual stock assessments.

Quality codes follow: **‘High’**: High confidence and consistency. Taxonomy is stable and reliable at this level, and field identification characteristics are well known and reliable. **‘Moderate’**: Moderate confidence. Taxonomy may be questionable at this level, or field identification characteristics may be variable and difficult to assess consistently. **‘Low’**: Low confidence. Taxonomy is incompletely known, or reliable field identification characteristics are unknown.
