# Metadata

## Data description

The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts fisheries-independent bottom trawl surveys to monitor the condition of the demersal fish and crab stocks of Alaska. These data are developed to describe the temporal distribution and abundance of commercially and ecologically important groundfish species, examine the changes in the species composition of the fauna over time and space, and describe the physical environment of the groundfish habitat.

There are no legal restrictions on access to the data. They reside in the public domain and can be freely distributed. Users must read and fully comprehend the metadata prior to use. Data should not be used beyond the limits of the source scale. Acknowledgement of NOAA, as the source from which these data were obtained, in any publications and/or other representations of these data, is suggested. These data are compiled and approved annually after each summer survey season. The data from previous years are unlikely to change substantially once published.

These data are non-zero (presence) observations from surveys conducted on fishing vessels. These surveys monitor trends in distribution and abundance of groundfish, crab, and bottom-dwelling species in Alaska’s marine ecosystems. These data include estimates of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for most identified species at a standard set of stations. Some survey data are excluded, such as non-standard stations, surveys completed in earlier years using different/non-standard gear, and special tows and non-standard data collections.

Though not included in the public data, these surveys also collect oceanographic and environmental data, and biological data such as length, weight, stomach contents (to learn more about diet), otoliths (fish ear bones to learn about age), and tissue samples for genetic analysis, all of which can be shared upon special request. Also not included in the public data are estimated biomass (average total weight of all fish and crabs sampled) of crabs and groundfish that support the creation of annual stock assessments.

## Table short metadata

`r table_metadata `

## Column-level metadata

```{r column-metadata, echo = FALSE}
column_metadata0 <- column_metadata
names(column_metadata0) <- c("Column name from data", "Descriptive Column Name", "Units", "Description")
knitr::kable(column_metadata0, row.names = FALSE) 
```

# Access the data

While pulling data, please keep in mind that this is a very large file. For reference: 

```{r oracle-data-size, echo = FALSE}
str0 <- paste0(
  "RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED: ", "
  rows: ", nrow(cpue_station_0filled), "
  cols: ", ncol(cpue_station_0filled), "
  ", round(file.size(paste0(dir_out, "cpue_station_0filled.csv"))/1e+9, 3), " GB") 
cat(str0)
```

## Access data interactively through the FOSS platform

Select, filter, and package this and other NOAA Fisheries data from the [Fisheries One Stop Shop (FOSS)](`r link_foss `) platform. This user-friendly portal is maintained through `Oracle APEX`. A useful intro to using APIs in `R` can be found [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/r-api-tutorial/).

### Connect to the API with R

```{r api-link, echo = TRUE}
 # install.packages(c("httr", "jsonlite"))
library("httr")
library("jsonlite")
 # link to the API
api_link <- "https://origin-tst-ods-st.fisheries.noaa.gov/ods/foss/afsc_groundfish_survey/"
```

### Select all data

```{r api-all-data-ex, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
res <- httr::GET(url = api_link)
 # res # Test connection
data <- jsonlite::fromJSON(base::rawToChar(res$content))
 # names(data)
knitr::kable(head(data$items, 3)) 
```

### Subset data

Here, as an example, we can subset the data for the 2018 Aleutian Islands Bottom Trawl Survey. 

```{r api-subset-ex, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
res <- httr::GET(url = api_link, query = list(year = "2018", srvy = "AI")
data <- jsonlite::fromJSON(base::rawToChar(res$content))
x <- data$items
x <- x[,c("srvy", "year", "stratum", "station", "vessel_name", "latitude_dd", "longitude_dd",
          "species_code", "common_name", "scientific_name", "taxon_confidence",
          "cpue_kgha", "cpue_noha", "weight_kg", "count",
          "bottom_temperature_c", "surface_temperature_c", "depth_m")]
knitr::kable(head(x, 3))
```

## Access data via Oracle

If the user has access to the AFSC `Oracle` database, the user can use `SQL developer` to view and pull the FOSS public data directly from the `RACEBASE_FOSS` `Oracle` schema. 

### Connect to Oracle from R

Many users will want to access the data from `Oracle` using `R`. The user will need to install the `RODBC` `R` package and ask OFIS (IT) connect `R` to `Oracle`. Then, use the following code in `R` to establish a connection from `R` to `Oracle`: 

Here, the user can write in their username and password directly into the `RODBC` connect function. Never save usernames or passwords in scripts that may be intentionally or unintentionally shared with others. 

```{r oracle-connect-1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("RODBC")
 # Define RODBC connection to ORACLE
channel<-odbcConnect(dsn = "AFSC",
                     uid = "USERS_USERNAME", # change
                     pwd = "USERS_PASSWORD", # change
                     believeNRows = FALSE)
odbcGetInfo(channel) # Execute the connection
```

Or have the script prompt the user for the connection info. Here, pop-ups will appear on the screen asking for the username and password. 

```{r oracle-connect-2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("RODBC")
library("getPass")
 # Define RODBC connection to ORACLE
get.connected <- function(schema='AFSC'){(echo=FALSE)
  username <- getPass(msg = "Enter your ORACLE Username: ")
  password <- getPass(msg = "Enter your ORACLE Password: ")
  channel  <- RODBC::odbcConnect(paste(schema),paste(username),paste(password), 
                                 believeNRows=FALSE)
}
channel <- get.connected() # Execute the connection
```

### Select all data

Once connected, pull and save (if needed) the table into the `R` environment. 

```{r oracle-data-pull, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
 # pull table from oracle into R environment
a <- RODBC::sqlQuery(channel, "SELECT * FROM RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED")
 # Save table to local directory
write.csv(x = a, file = "RACEBASE_FOSS-FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED.csv")
```

### Subset data

To pull a small subset of the data (especially since files like `RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED` are so big), use a variation of the following code. Here, we are pulling EBS Pacific cod from 2010 - 2021: 

```{r oracle-data-pull-subset, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
 # Pull data
a <- RODBC::sqlQuery(channel, "SELECT * FROM RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED 
WHERE SRVY = 'EBS' 
AND COMMON_NAME = 'Pacific cod' 
AND YEAR >= 2010 
AND YEAR < 2021")
 # Save table to local directory
write.csv(x = a, file = "RACEBASE_FOSS-FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED-ebs_pcod_2010-2020.csv")
```

# Suggestions and comments

If the data or metadata can be improved, please create a pull request, [submit an issue to the GitHub organization](`r "https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/data-requests/issues"`), [submit an issue to the code's repository](`r paste0(link_repo, "/issues")`), reach out the the survey team leads (listed above), or to [Fisheries One Stop Shop (FOSS)](`r link_foss `) platform managers.
